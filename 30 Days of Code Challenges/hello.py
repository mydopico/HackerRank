# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, 
# print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable 
# on a second line.

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
inputString = raw_input() # ex. Welcome to 30 Days of Code!

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print 'Hello, World.' + "\n" + inputString
